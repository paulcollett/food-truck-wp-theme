Hi! Adding CSS/JS?
=============================

First off, we don't reccommend changing source CSS/JS files - it makes it super hard to upgrade your theme

So.. to add custom css / js:
- Consider using a child theme
- or, simply add css (or, javascript) via the Food Truck Theme Admin Page (reccomended)

To add HTML:
- use the "advanced" module in your page or posts. It lets you drop-in HTML anywhere on your page (reccomended)
- Also, if you know PHP we have a bunch of wordpress hooks to inject HTML throughout your site (find hooks in page.php)
Happy coding!
